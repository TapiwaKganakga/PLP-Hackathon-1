This is a personal portfolio website built using only HTML5 and CSS. No JavaScript, no frameworks — just clean, semantic code and responsive design.
The project focuses on simplicity, speed, and cross-browser compatibility.

So. What are it's features?

A Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Fully semantic HTML5 structure for accessibility and SEO.

Custom CSS for layout, styling, and transitions.

Lightweight and fast-loading — no external libraries or dependencies.

Project Structure

index.html: The main html page.
  Inside there you will find a total of 5 Sections.
    The Navigation Bar (Navbar)
    The Main section with my name and photo (The Hero Section)
    The Skills section
    The Testimony Section
    And the Contact Section with a static contact form. 

The navbar is how you navigate the site. It also has access to my Github page, my linkedin and my personal email to reach out to me. 

The Skill section highlights the type of languages and frameworks i'm familiar with. 
I'm quite lacking in some compaired to others like react. But I decided that putting it there is better than nothing.

The Testimony section contains a placeholder image with a placeholder name, but a real testimony from a client that I once assisted. 
She requested privacy, and so I abided. Hope this does not break any rules.

The contact section contains a contact form. It's fully static since within the rules of the Hackathon, no server wide backend is allowed. I felt it was right to include it regardless.

Hackathon 1/styles.css: Path to the main stylesheet.

Hackathon 1/images/: Folder for all the pictures used in the portfolio.

This portfolio is built with mobile-first principles, meaning it’s designed for smaller screens first, then enhanced for larger viewports. 
The CSS is modular and organized by section to make updates and maintenance easy. 
All interactivity and layout are handled purely with CSS — there is no JavaScript included.

Here's to me having a chance at winning the Hackathon! I'll await eagerly for the 8th of August.

Thank you!
